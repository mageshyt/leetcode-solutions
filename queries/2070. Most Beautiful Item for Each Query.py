"""
You are given a 2D integer array items where items[i] = [pricei, beautyi] denotes the price and beauty of an item respectively.

You are also given a 0-indexed integer array queries. For each queries[j], you want to determine the maximum beauty of an item whose price is less than or equal to queries[j]. If no such item exists, then the answer to this query is 0.

Return an array answer of the same length as queries where answer[j] is the answer to the jth query.

Example 1:

Input: items = [[1,2],[3,2],[2,4],[5,6],[3,5]], queries = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [2,4,5,5,6,6]
Explanation:
- For queries[0]=1, [1,2] is the only item which has price <= 1. Hence, the answer for this query is 2.
- For queries[1]=2, the items which can be considered are [1,2] and [2,4]. 
  The maximum beauty among them is 4.
- For queries[2]=3 and queries[3]=4, the items which can be considered are [1,2], [3,2], [2,4], and [3,5].
  The maximum beauty among them is 5.
- For queries[4]=5 and queries[5]=6, all items can be considered.
  Hence, the answer for them is the maximum beauty of all items, i.e., 6.
