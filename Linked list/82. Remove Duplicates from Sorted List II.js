`Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Return the linked list sorted as well.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5]
Output: [1,2,5]`;

const deleteDuplicates = (head) => {
  let dummy = new ListNode(0, head);
  let prev = dummy;
  while ( !head) {
    // ! if we find a duplicate, we need to skip it
    if (head.next !== null && head.val === head.next.val) {
      while (head.next !== null && head.val === head.next.val) {
        head = head.next;
      }
      prev.next = head.next;
    } else {
      prev = prev.next;
    }
    head = head.next;
  }
  return dummy.next;
};
