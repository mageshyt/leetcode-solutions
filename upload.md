Hi guys ,After a long time, I finally got the chance to Make solution.

What the Question asking us to do  ðŸ¤”?

Given an integer array nums of size n, return the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal.

In one move, you can increment or decrement an element of the array by 1.

Basically, you can choose any element of the array and increment or decrement other elements to make them equal to the chosen element

Approach Explanation :
   1. we are going to sort the array
   2. we are going to find the number of moves required to make all array elements equal
   3. for that we are going to chose the middle element and increment or decrement other elements to make them equal to the chosen element

    Big o:
        n-->size of the nums
        Time: O(nlog) --> we are going to sort the array which is O(nlog)
        Space: O(1)

```
