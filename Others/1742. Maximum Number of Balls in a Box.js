`You are working in a ball factory where you have n balls numbered from lowLimit up to highLimit inclusive (i.e., n == highLimit - lowLimit + 1), and an infinite number of boxes numbered from 1 to infinity.

Your job at this factory is to put each ball in the box with a number equal to the sum of digits of the ball's number. For example, the ball number 321 will be put in the box number 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 and the ball number 10 will be put in the box number 1 + 0 = 1.

Given two integers lowLimit and highLimit, return the number of balls in the box with the most balls.

 

Example 1:

Input: lowLimit = 1, highLimit = 10
Output: 2
Explanation:
Box Number:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 ...
Ball Count:  2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0  0  ...
Box 1 has the most number of balls with 2 balls.
Example 2:

Input: lowLimit = 5, highLimit = 15
Output: 2
Explanation:
Box Number:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 ...
Ball Count:  1 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 0  0  ...
Boxes 5 and 6 have the most number of balls with 2 balls in each.
Example 3:

Input: lowLimit = 19, highLimit = 28
Output: 2
Explanation:
Box Number:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 ...
Ball Count:  0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2  0  0  ...
Box 10 has the most number of balls with 2 balls.`;

//! Approach:

`
first we will create an object to store the number of balls in each box
We will start from the lowLimit and iterate through the highLimit
    with helper function we will get sum of digits of the current number
    if the sum is already present in the object we will increment the count
    else we will add the sum as key and 1 as value

`;

const sumDigits = (num) => {
  let sum = 0;
  while (num > 0) {
    sum += num % 10;
    num = Math.floor(num / 10);
  }
  return sum;
};
const countBalls = (lowLimit, highLimit) => {
  const hash = new Map();
  for (let i = lowLimit; i <= highLimit; i++) {
    let sum = sumDigits(i);
    hash.set(sum, (hash.get(sum) || 0) + 1);
  }
  return Math.max(...hash.values());
};
console.log(countBalls(1, 10));
