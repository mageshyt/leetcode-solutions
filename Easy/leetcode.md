Hello guys ðŸ˜€ !

Given question:
    Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

    You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.


Question Explanation:
    basically, we need to reverse the string with constant space


Explanation:
    lets declare a variable called left and right.
    left = 0
    right = len(nums) - 1
    we will keep on looping until left is less than right.


Big O:
    n--> number of elements in the array
    Time Complexity: O(n) 
    Space Complexity: O(1)
