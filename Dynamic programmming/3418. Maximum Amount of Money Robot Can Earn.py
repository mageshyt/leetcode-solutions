"""
You are given an m x n grid. A robot starts at the top-left corner of the grid (0, 0) and wants to reach the bottom-right corner (m - 1, n - 1). The robot can move either right or down at any point in time.

The grid contains a value coins[i][j] in each cell:

If coins[i][j] >= 0, the robot gains that many coins.
If coins[i][j] < 0, the robot encounters a robber, and the robber steals the absolute value of coins[i][j] coins.
The robot has a special ability to neutralize robbers in at most 2 cells on its path, preventing them from stealing coins in those cells.

Note: The robot's total coins can be negative.

Return the maximum profit the robot can gain on the route.

 

Example 1:

Input: coins = [[0,1,-1],[1,-2,3],[2,-3,4]]

Output: 8
