"""
operation on the array any number of times:

Select an index i such that 0 <= i < n - 1 and replace either of nums[i] or nums[i+1] with their gcd value.
Return the minimum number of operations to make all elements of nums equal to 1. If it is impossible, return -1.

The gcd of two integers is the greatest common divisor of the two integers.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,6,3,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can do the following operations:
- Choose index i = 2 and replace nums[2] with gcd(3,4) = 1. Now we have nums = [2,6,1,4].
- Choose index i = 1 and replace nums[1] with gcd(6,1) = 1. Now we have nums = [2,1,1,4].
- Choose index i = 0 and replace nums[0] with gcd(2,1) = 1. Now we have nums = [1,1,1,4].
- Choose index i = 2 and replace nums[3] with gcd(1,4) = 1. Now we have nums = [1,1,1,1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,10,6,14]
Output: -1
Explanation: It can be shown that it is impossible to make all the elements equal to 1.
 

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 50
1 <= nums[i] <= 106
